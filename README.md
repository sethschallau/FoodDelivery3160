## Introduction
This Food Delivery service is providing a service to universities that works with security and safety procedures. 
A university who purchases a license can run an instance of the application and distribute the app to their students. This will allow faculty to stay in control of who is delivering food on campus, and where that food is coming from.

## Use Case
This application will be used by universities that do not want independent contractors on campus, but still desire food delivery service.

## Business Rules
Each Order must have a delivery attached. Each Driver must be a student and or faculty. Establishments can be added by students or faculty, but must be approved by faculty. Each drop-off location must be a university building. Each delivery must have a driver and a recipient who can be a student or faculty. Each Delivery must have an establishment and drop off location. Deliveries must be marked complete when completed

## EERD

## MySQL Queries
In our setup we will be using the usual create table queries. A simple example would be as follows:
1. INSERT INTO 'deliveries' (id, location, dropoff, student, driver, completed) VALUES (1, Cookout, Wallis Hall, Seth, Ethan, no);
2. CREATE TABLE delivieries;
3. UPDATE deliveries WHERE ID == 1 SET completed = yes;

## Trigger
When a new order is submitted to the database a delivery object will be created. When an order is marked completed the delivery should be updated to reflect a successful delivery. When a new establishment is submitted a faculty member of the app should be notified. 

## Stored Procedure

## Future Work
In the future we will need to create a mobile app to pair with our database. Business-wise, we would also like to sell this to companies and modify the student requirement.

## MySQL Dump
We will backup the database with MySQL dump. This will be necessary to preserve records for future use and for data mining purposes.
